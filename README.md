# Project Description
In recent years the sneaker market has been exploding. One niche within this market is the reseller market, where people buy sneaker to shortly flip them for profit. The sneaker resale market itself is expected to grow for many years to come. But what does make certain sneaker perform better than others? 

This we aim to find out by predicting the profitability of sneakers expressed as a ratio of reseller and retail price from the perspective of a reseller. In other words, we want to know what features can help us identify the next big hype sneaker.

# About the Dataset
For this project we used a dataset from the 2019 StockX Data Contest. You can find the dataset [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/stockx-sneaker-analysis/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/StockX-Data-Contest-2019-3.xlsx).

The dataset consists of a random sample of all Off-White x Nike and Yeezy 350 sneaker transactions between 9/1/2017 and 13/02/2019. In total there  are 99.956 total sales in the data set. The sample consists of U.S. sales data only.

# Conclusion:
There is a clearly a hype around certain sneaker models and some of them can make extraordinary returns in a short period of time. To increase our chances to maximize profits we should aim for:
- Buying the right models (Off-White beats Yeezy anytime), particulary Off-White X Air Jordan collaborations work pretty well
- Longer time holding periods don't necessarily go hand in hand with higher profits, instead we can use shorter time frames to buy and flip and then continute the reselling process again and again
- The female and male average shoe sizes (surprisingly 🙃 ) work best
